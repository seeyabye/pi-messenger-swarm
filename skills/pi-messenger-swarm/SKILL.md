# Pi-Messenger Swarm Skill

Multi-agent coordination via the `pi-messenger-swarm` CLI.

The CLI auto-spawns a long-lived HTTP server (the **harness**) on first use. Every call dispatches an action to the harness, which holds persistent state — agent registrations, task store, feed — across calls.

- No fixed planner/worker/reviewer roles
- Any joined or spawned agent can create/claim/complete tasks
- When you spawn agents for tasks, act as coordinator — delegate, don't hoard

## Setup

If installed globally (`npm install -g pi-messenger-swarm`), the `pi-messenger-swarm` command is on your PATH. Otherwise, the extension installs a shell wrapper script at `~/.pi/agent/bin/pi-messenger-swarm` which pi adds to PATH automatically — no manual setup needed.

Agent identity is resolved by the CLI using the `PI_AGENT_NAME` environment variable (set by the parent on spawn). The CLI sends this to the harness server, which matches it against registrations on disk. If `PI_AGENT_NAME` is not set (e.g., human terminal), the CLI falls back to walking the process tree to find the parent `pi` process PID.

```
pi-messenger-swarm join
pi-messenger-swarm task list
pi-messenger-swarm swarm
```

## Core protocol

1. Join first

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm join
```

2. Inspect swarm state

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm swarm
pi-messenger-swarm task list
```

3. Delegate before claiming

If you spawned subagents for specific tasks, **do not claim those tasks yourself** — your spawned agents will claim and execute them. Only claim tasks you intend to implement personally (typically tasks you did not delegate).

```bash
# Delegate to a spawned agent
pi-messenger-swarm spawn --task-id task-1 --role Debugger "Fix the race condition"
# Do NOT also: pi-messenger-swarm task claim task-1
```

4. Claim only tasks you will implement yourself

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm task claim task-1
```

5. Reserve files before edits

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm reserve src/auth/ --reason task-1
```

6. Log progress and complete

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm task progress task-1 "Implemented JWT verification"
pi-messenger-swarm task done task-1 "Auth middleware + tests"
pi-messenger-swarm release
```

## Command reference

### Coordination

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm join [--channel dev] [--create]
pi-messenger-swarm status
pi-messenger-swarm list
pi-messenger-swarm channels [--all]
pi-messenger-swarm feed [--limit 20] [--channel dev]
pi-messenger-swarm send AgentName "hello"
pi-messenger-swarm send #memory "remember this"
pi-messenger-swarm reserve src/ --reason task-1
pi-messenger-swarm release
pi-messenger-swarm whois AgentName
pi-messenger-swarm set-status "debugging auth"
pi-messenger-swarm rename NewName
```

### Swarm board

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm swarm [--channel dev]
```

### Task operations

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm task list
pi-messenger-swarm task ready
pi-messenger-swarm task stalled
pi-messenger-swarm task show task-3
pi-messenger-swarm task stalled              # List tasks with no recent progress
pi-messenger-swarm task create --title "Fix token refresh race"
pi-messenger-swarm task create --title "..." --content "..." --depends-on task-2
pi-messenger-swarm task claim task-3
pi-messenger-swarm task unclaim task-3
pi-messenger-swarm task progress task-3 "Fixed the race"
pi-messenger-swarm task done task-3 "Auth middleware + tests"
pi-messenger-swarm task block task-3 --reason "Awaiting API key"
pi-messenger-swarm task unblock task-3
pi-messenger-swarm task reset task-3 [--cascade]
pi-messenger-swarm task archive-done
```

### Dynamic subagent spawning

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm spawn --role Researcher "Analyze competitor X"
pi-messenger-swarm spawn --role Analyst --persona "Skeptical market researcher" "Find productization gaps"
pi-messenger-swarm spawn --task-id task-1 --role Debugger "Fix the race condition"
pi-messenger-swarm spawn --agent-file agents/researcher.md "Analyze the codebase"
pi-messenger-swarm spawn --objective "Find bugs" --context "Focus on auth" --role Auditor "Review code"
pi-messenger-swarm spawn --message-file /tmp/mission.txt --role Researcher
pi-messenger-swarm spawn list
pi-messenger-swarm spawn history
pi-messenger-swarm spawn stop <id>
```

> **Shell safety**: When mission text contains backticks, `${...}`, parentheses, or other shell-sensitive characters, use `--message-file <path>` instead of a positional argument. Write the prompt to a temp file first to avoid bash interpolation corrupting the mission text.

#### Agent file format

`--agent-file` points to a markdown file with optional YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter supplies role/persona/model/objective defaults; the body after `---` becomes the system prompt.

```markdown
---
role: Security Reviewer
persona: Paranoid about edge cases
objective: Review code for security vulnerabilities
---

You are a security expert. Focus on input validation and auth boundaries.
```

Frontmatter fields (all optional):

| Field       | Purpose                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `role`      | Agent role label (default: `Subagent`)     |
| `persona`   | Tone/behavior modifier                     |
| `model`     | Default model (overridable at spawn time)  |
| `objective` | Default mission (overridable via CLI text) |

If the file has no frontmatter, the entire file content is used as the system prompt with `role` defaulting to `Subagent`.

CLI flags override frontmatter values — for example, `--role` overrides `role:`, and positional mission text overrides `objective:`.

### Server management

| Command                        | Behavior                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `pi-messenger-swarm --status`  | Print health JSON or exit 1                 |
| `pi-messenger-swarm --start`   | Start the harness server                    |
| `pi-messenger-swarm --stop`    | Graceful shutdown                           |
| `pi-messenger-swarm --restart` | Soft restart: clear caches, preserve agents |
| `pi-messenger-swarm --logs`    | `tail -f` the server log                    |

### JSON passthrough

For programmatic use or complex actions, JSON is still accepted:

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm '{ "action": "join", "channel": "dev" }'
pi-messenger-swarm '{ "action": "spawn", "role": "Researcher", "message": "Analyze X", "taskId": "task-1" }'
```

## Swarm Philosophy

The swarm is self-organizing. Your role is participant, not manager.

### Pull-based messaging, push-based spawn completion and messages

Messages and state changes are written to the channel feed. For general state (task updates, joins, edits), you must read the feed yourself between turns.

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm feed --limit 10
```

This is kafka-like: channels are durable logs, agents subscribe by reading. If you don't read the feed, state changes sit there until you do.

**Exception: direct messages and spawn completion are push-based.** When someone sends you a message via `pi-messenger-swarm send YourName "..."`, you are automatically notified — no polling required. Similarly, when a spawned agent finishes, you receive a `spawn_completion` notification automatically.

> **Offline messages:** push delivery only works while your pi session is running. Messages sent to you while your session was closed are persisted in the feed but are not retroactively pushed (the notification cursor is primed to the newest existing message on startup to avoid re-notifying old traffic). After (re)joining, run `pi-messenger-swarm feed --limit 20` to catch up on anything you missed.

Good pattern: read the feed at decision points, then act.

- Before claiming: check what's ready
- After spawning: trust the agent to execute — you'll be notified on completion
- On uncertainty: read the feed, then message the agent directly
- Periodically: check for stalled tasks that need re-delegation

### Spawn completion callbacks

When a spawned agent completes (or fails/stops), the system automatically:

1. **Writes a feed event** to the current channel (`spawn.completed`, `spawn.failed`, or `spawn.stopped`), visible via `pi-messenger-swarm feed`
2. **Notifies the coordinator agent** via an in-process message — you will receive a `spawn_completion` notification that triggers your next turn automatically

**You do not need to poll or sleep to wait for spawned agents.** After spawning, continue with other work or simply end your turn. When a spawned agent finishes, you will be notified with the agent name, role, status, and a summary. The notification includes the task ID so you can immediately check the output:

```
🔔 Spawned agent Researcher (Researcher) completed (task: task-1).
  Summary: Analyzed codebase and found 3 issues.
  Check output: pi-messenger-swarm task show task-1
```

Do NOT use `bash({ command: "sleep 30" })` or polling loops to wait for spawn completion. The callback is automatic.

After receiving a spawn completion notification:

- Check the task output with `pi-messenger-swarm task show <task-id>`
- If the agent failed, review the error and decide whether to re-delegate
- If all spawned tasks are complete, review results and synthesize

### Spawn-and-delegate, don't hoard

When you spawn subagents, you are the coordinator. You create the tasks, spawn the agents, then **step back**. Let the agents claim and execute their assigned work — do not claim those tasks yourself.

Your role after spawning:

- Wait for completion notifications (automatic — no polling needed)
- Unblock agents when they hit problems (share context, clarify scope)
- Handle only tasks you did **not** delegate to a subagent

Anti-pattern: spawning agents then claiming all tasks yourself. This leaves spawned agents idle with nothing to do.

### Collaborate, don't micromanage

Subagents execute with full context. They report progress through task updates and messaging. Stay available for collaboration without inserting yourself into their loop.

Engage when:

- They reach out with a question or blocker
- You have relevant context they lack (share it proactively)
- Output reveals a misunderstanding of constraints
- The work naturally intersects with yours

Let them own their execution. Your value is in strategic context and unblocking, not status checks.

### Reading agent output

The feed (`pi-messenger-swarm feed`) shows one-line previews. For full findings and detail, use:

```bash
pi-messenger-swarm task show task-1   # Full spec + progress log
```

Agents are instructed to write all findings into `task progress` and `task done` messages — not just their response text — so everything is in the task record.

## Storage layout

Swarm data is **project-scoped by default** (isolated per project):

```
.pi/messenger/
├── channels/
│   └── <channel>.jsonl       # Metadata header (line 1) + feed events
├── tasks/                    # Task event JSONL (per session)
│   └── <session>.jsonl
├── agents/                   # Spawn event JSONL (per session)
│   └── <session>.jsonl
└── locks/                    # Race-safe coordination locks
```

### Override locations

```bash
# Custom directory
PI_MESSENGER_DIR=/path/to/dir pi

# Legacy global mode (all projects share state - not recommended)
PI_MESSENGER_GLOBAL=1 pi
```
